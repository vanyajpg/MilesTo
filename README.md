# How many milesTo...? ðŸŒŽ

MilesTo is a MERN application encouraging you to reach your daily step goals. This application gives you insight into the overall metrics on how many miles you have walked in the last month, or even the last year!

As someone who is now living in NYC, I thought it would be extremely fascinating to be able to tally up all the miles I have ever walked in the last few months. When you use MilesTo, that is now possible at the click of a button!

# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, TailwindCSS, EmbeddedJavaScript, MongoDB

MilesTo initially began as a means for me to monitor and track my own progress. In an effort to provide a clear and visual representation of my walking achievements over time, I embarked on enhancing the app's functionality by incorporating a calendar view.


# Optimizations
Eventually, I hope to add in the ability to sort the recorded walking days by month allowing users to review their walking history on a month-to-month basis. Additionally, I have plans to develop a dynamic dashboard that provides a visual representation of users' progress and consistency over time. 


# Lessons Learned:

MilesTo has been helpful in reinforcing my grasp of leveraging EJS to conduct computations driven by user inputs. This application has helped me in deepening my understanding of seamlessly integrating user interactions with EJS templates, allowing me to craft customized calculations grounded in the data users provide.
